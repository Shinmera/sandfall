# sandfall
Falling sands simulator.

I found this code left over from some time I was bored at work. Only named "neato" it took some analysis to figure out
whta the goal was, as I had forgotten this. It seems it's for simulating pixelated falling sands and perhaps water. Very
early version of such a thing though.

So I decided to clean up the code a bit, make it actually compile, and push it to git so I might look at it closer at
home.
